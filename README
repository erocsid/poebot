I. Description
________________________________________________________________________________

poebot is an IRC bot written in Perl and usable anywhere Perl is installed with
the required modules.

It is written to be very flexible; each command is a seperate module that can
do just about anything you want. Information on writing your own modules is
available at the website, or by reading the provided modules for yourself.


II. Requirements
________________________________________________________________________________

Perl 5.x

POE::Component::IRC is the only required module. Addon scripts may require
other modules.

A MySQL database is suggested, many modules like to use them, but not required.


III. Installation
________________________________________________________________________________

Detailed installation instructions are available at http://discore.org/poebot

Quick installation breakdown:
  1) edit the config file
  2) edit the modules_loaded file to select which commands to load
  3) run the bot

Each command you load into poebot may require additional steps. Most commands
should have documentation written inside of them; check the modules/command.pm
files for instructions on making them work.

If you decide to use defines.pm and/or quotes.pm, you probably want to source
the schema files in the utils directory to create the tables required.

If you decide to use weather.pm, you must edit the modules/weather.pm file to
add some required information like cache directory and weather.com license key.

ping.pm is an example module that can get you started writing your own.


IV. Miscellaneous
________________________________________________________________________________

The utils directory has a few useful things.

botchk.sh is a script largely stolen from the old eggdrop files that checks to
see if your bot is running. Edit it and set some required variables then throw
it into your crontab.

poebot.cgi is a simple web frontend to the defines and quotes database. Edit it
and set some required variables then put it into a directory you can ExecCGI
from.

The schema files are used to create the tables for defines.pm and quotes.pm.


V. Known Bugs
________________________________________________________________________________

2011-11-05 - the dictionary module is broken
